Motivation: 

As many of streaming-services operate on dataset with seconds of timeframe, size of data has been known to grow expotentially large. Size of data has quickly outgrow memory-limit of most computers. To ensure analytical-activities to be performed in normal, we have to utilize power-of-spark in performing distributed-data-analytics task to obtain insights from the data. We would like to understand factors that contribute to users-churning-behaviors.


Packages required:

Pandas
pyspark
matplot
numpy
